        <h2>What is Hosting?
        <p>
hosting means storing files and data on a server so they can be accessed by other computers on a network or the internet. 
This can refer to the act of hosting files for a website, or it can refer to the service that provides the server space, known as a web hosting provider. The server itself is the "host" that provides these services, whether it's a physical server or a virtual one. 
        </p>
        <p>Examples: GoDaddy or Icloud</p>
